	Classes and Objects
		- Members of the class. Access levels . Encapsulation.
		- Class: interface + implementation
		- Constructors and destructors
		- const member functions
		- Constructor initializer
		- Copy constructor
		- Object's life cycle

	Types of Classes
		- Polymorphic Classes <designed for extension>
		- Value classes <designed for storing values>
		- RAII ( Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
			encapsulate a resource into a class --> resource lifetime object life time
			* thread, unique_ptr, ..

	Class = type ( Data + Operation)
		- Data
			- data members( properties, attributes )
		- Operation
			- methods(behaviour)
		- Each member is associated with an access level
			- private
			- public
			- protected

	Object = Instance of a class
		- properties, behaviours

	Employee.h ( Interface )
	Employee.xpp ( Implementation )
